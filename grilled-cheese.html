<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>Meet the <strong>ULTIMATE</strong> comfort food: a 
crispy golden exterious thats a hug for your taste buds, with
a warm cheesy secret inside. The age-old love story of bread <em>and</em>
cheese, in a quick and easy recipe!</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Sourdough Bread (You can use any kind, although I prefer sourdough.)</li>
    <li>Cheddar Cheese</li>
    <li>Butter or Mayonaisse</li>
    <li><strong>OPTIONAL:</strong> Cooked Bacon</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Using your butter or mayonaisse, spread and even layer
        on one side of the bread. The butter/mayo is what makes the 
        bread crispy in the pan, so make sure the butter/mayo side of bread 
        stays on the outside.
    </li>
    <li>On the side of bread that isnt buttered, place the cheddar cheese
        evenly on the surface. (If you are using bacon now is the time to add
        it to the sandwhich) Close the sandwhich.
    </li>
    <li>Heat a skillet/frying pan on medium heat (there is no need to add butter 
        or oil to the pan, since we already buttered the bread). Place the sandwhich 
        onto the skillet and let cook for roughly 5 minutes, or until the bread
        becomes golden brown and crispy. Flip and repeat.
    </li>
    <li>Finally, cut your sandwhich in half and <strong>ENJOY!</strong> For a more filling meal, 
        you can serve with tomato soup to dip you sandwhich into, yum!
    </li>

</ol>
