</ul>

<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cook the sushi rice using a 1:2 ratio with rice and water.
        Once the rice is cooked at 2 teaspoons of rice wine vinegar to the rice and mix
        to combine. (RWV will make the rice less sticky and easier to handle.) 
    </li>
    <li>Spread an even ammount of rice over the nori sheeet leaving an inch in width 
        of space on one end of the nori sheet. (This will help us wrap the sushi later.)
    </li>
    <li>Flip the nori sheet over so the rice is underneath. </li>
    <li>To the nori add your cucumber, avacado, and crab/prawn, in uniform row in 
        center of the nori sheet.
    </li>
    <li>Now it is time to roll up your sushi! Add water to the top of the Nori
        sheet and begin to roll the sushi from the bottom to the top. Use the 
        area of the nori that is wet to stick to the rice.
    </li>
    <li>Once satisfied with your sushi roll, you can begin to roll the sushi in seasame 
        seeds, to coat the outside of the roll. 
    </li>
    <li>Slice roll into even sushi sized peices and serce with wasabi, and soy sauce.
    </li>
    <li><strong>ENJOY!</strong></li>
</ol>
